          <p>
            As a self-taught data scientist, I have gained extensive knowledge
            and practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and
            statistical modeling. I have expanded my skill set by working as a
            full-stack developer, where I have honed my abilities in front-end.
            My expertise in data science and development enables me to approach
            problems from a holistic perspective, bridging the gap between data
            analysis and software development. Through my passion for both data
            science and software development, I am constantly striving to stay
            up-to-date with the latest industry trends and techniques. I am
            eager to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to exciting
            and impactful projects.
